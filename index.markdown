## Linear Delta Arrays for Compliant Dexterous Distributed Manipulation

This website is meant to be a complimentary overview of the design methodology of the delta arrays and provide step-by-step instructions for getting started with the setup. Here we provide a basic tutorial to:
* Get started with building a delta robot
* Control a 2x2 module of delta robots using a custom shield 
* The final 8x8 Array is a design we chose with 16 modular 2x2 modules. The 2x2 modules are designed to be modular and can be used to build any size array.

Please find code for making the arrays work here:
